# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
This line imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions, including sqrt (square root).
### Step 2:
This line assigns values to four variables: x1, x2, y1, and y2. These variables represent the coordinates of two points in a 2D plane. 
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:
This line prints the calculated distance, rounded to two decimal places, using the round function.
### Step 5:
This program calculates and prints the distance between the points (10, 6) and (4, 2) in a 2D plane.
### step 6:
end program 
### PROGRAM:
```
Distance between points

import math
list1=[4,2]
list2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt((list2[0] - list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)
print(round(distance,2))
```
